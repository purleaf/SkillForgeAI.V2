                { "id": 1, "text": "Botanically, a fruit is an organ of a plant that contains and protects the seeds of the plant as they grow and often helps them to be dispersed.\nThis broad definition of fruit includes not only produce like apples, oranges, and grapes, but also many vegetables like tomatoes and cucumbers as well as the pods of legumes and the hulls of grain." },
                { "id": 2, "text": "Fruits are classified in many ways, but the simplest distinction is made between fleshy fruits and dry fruits. Fleshy fruits are composed of moisture-rich cells and they are often sweet and juicy, although there are exceptions like oil-rich olives and avocados. Conversely, dry fruits are composed of dry, dead cells and are generally not edible although the seeds they contain often are." },
                { "id": 3, "text": "Dry fruits are further divided into two categories; those that split open when they are ripe and those that do not. Within these three broad categories, there are many subcategories of specialized fruit types." },
                { "id": 4, "text": "Regardless of their categorization, all fruits began their existence as flowers. Flowers play a central role in the life cycle of most plants as they contain reproductive structures. The majority of flowering plants produce \"perfect\" flowers that are hermaphroditicâ€”they contain both male and female reproductive structures. Other plants produce \"imperfect\" flowers that contain either male or female structures. When a plant species produces imperfect flowers, it may produce both distinctly male and female flowers on the same individual plant, or different plants will be exclusively male or exclusively female." },
                { "id": 5, "text": "The female structures of a flower are found in the pistil at the center, which includes the ovary at the base, the long stalk called a style that grows up from the ovary, and the stigma at the top of the style. Surrounding the pistil are the male structures called stamens. They are thin stalks with pollen producing anthers at their tops. In order for a plant to reproduce, pollen must be moved from the anthers to the stigma. The transfer of pollen between the two structures is usually accomplished via organisms that visit the flower, like bees, or by the wind. Once pollen reaches the stigma, it travels down the style to the ovary, where it fertilizes an ovule. With imperfect flowers, the transfer must take place between different flowers, but perfect flowers may be fertilized by their own pollen or pollen from other flowers. Once a flower is fertilized, its future seeds begin to form, and the ovary begins to grow into a protective fruit." },
                { "id": 6, "text": "Flowers share the same basic internal structure, but their subtle differences cause them to produce very different fruit. Fleshy fruits typically fall into one of four categories. Drupes such as peaches have a single seed with an extremely hard shell called a stone that is surrounded by a thick layer of flesh. Berries such as tomatoes have many seeds without a protective stone. Aggregate fruits such as raspberries develop from a flower with many pistils that fuse into a dense cluster of smaller fruits. Multiple fruits such as pineapples are formed by the fusion of several grouped flowers that eventually merge into one fruit. For example, a strawberry is called an accessory fruit because the juicy portion that is eaten is actually a part of the stem, while the genuine fruits are the small seeds that dot its surface.\nThe fruits that farmers raise today are vastly different from the original wild plants as thousands of years of selective breeding have substantially altered their size, sweetness, and nutritional value. Scientists have found samples of maize in Central and South America that revealed."},
                { "id": 7, "text": "The original plants look much like modern grass with a single row of small seeds on the stalk, unlike the corn cobs grown today. Paintings from centuries ago have shown that many fleshy fruits are quite different today as well. For example, a 400 year old still-life painting of fruit shows that watermelons used to be mostly bitter rind with pockets of edible red flesh around large seeds deep inside, while modern watermelons are predominately juicy red flesh and some are nearly seedless."}
